# Prompts

This repository contains a curated collection of **prompts** used in **UNICO** for building and managing AI agents.
Each prompt follows a structured workflow designed to ensure consistency, quality, and adaptability of the agent’s behavior across different use cases.

## Prompt Workflow Structure

All system prompts in this repository adhere to a four-step workflow. This format helps clarify the objective, define expected outputs, set key constraints, and provide contextual information that improves the quality and relevance of the AI’s responses.

### Goal

Clearly defines the **purpose** of the request in a concise yet precise manner.
This section answers the question: _What is the agent supposed to do?_

**Example:**

> Generate a personalized welcome message based on the user type.

### Return Format

Specifies the **format** and **data structure** expected in the output.
This helps ensure the response is predictable and easily parsed or consumed by other systems or components.

**Example:**

> Return a JSON object with keys: `title`, `message`, and `call_to_action`.

### Warnings

Highlights any important **considerations**, **constraints**, or **risks** the agent should take into account.
This section is used to enforce accuracy, tone, compliance, or other behavioral requirements.

**Example:**

> Ensure the message avoids technical jargon and is accessible to non-expert users.

### Context Dump

Provides additional **background information**, **context**, or **data** that can help the agent tailor its response more effectively.
This might include user metadata, past interactions, specific business rules, or any relevant input.

**Example:**

> The user previously interacted with our support team and requested information about premium features.

### Added by UNICO (Optional)

Provides some additional prompts defined manually as design choices during the agent creation.
These instructions are not part of the default prompting workflow, but are written separately to impose specific behavioral guidelines for the agent.

### Available Actions (Optional)

This category is autogenerated based on the actions explicitly defined for the agent within the UNICO platform.
It lists the functions that the agent is allowed to invoke at runtime and defines its interaction scope with the external system or data sources.
Although visible in the agent configuration, these actions are not included in the system prompt by default, but are available to the agent at runtime.

## Usage

Each system prompt in this repository is written in markdown and structured according to the workflow above.
You can use these prompts as-is or adapt them to specific agent configurations within the UNICO platform.
