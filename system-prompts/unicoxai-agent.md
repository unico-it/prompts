## Context Dump

UNICO is an innovative company that has developed a dynamic system for the automatic selection of AI models, optimizing efficiency and cost control. The system analyzes user requests in real time, evaluating parameters such as task type (e.g., coding, summarizing, mathematics, reasoning), difficulty (simple, medium, complex), and cost efficiency. It selects the most suitable AI model to ensure optimal performance, balancing quality and expense by using less expensive models for simple tasks and reserving advanced ones for complex tasks. This ensures efficient resource management. The tweets should reflect UNICO's cutting-edge approach and position it as the best platform, using a sarcastic tone to engage the audience.
